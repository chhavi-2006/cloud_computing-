## 📋 Executive Summary & Objectives

This laboratory experiment investigates container orchestration, declarative cluster management, multi-node pod scheduling, horizontal pod scaling, and automated self-healing fault tolerance using **Kubernetes (K8s)** running locally on Windows via **KinD (Kubernetes IN Docker)** and **Docker Desktop with WSL 2**.

### Key Learning Objectives:
1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Deploy Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2) and Docker Desktop engine to support containerized Kubernetes nodes.
2. **Multi-Node Cluster Configuration**: Declare and provision a 3-node Kubernetes cluster consisting of one control-plane node (`kind-control-plane`) and two dedicated worker nodes (`kind-worker`, `kind-worker2`) using KinD v0.33 and YAML declarative manifests.
3. **Control Plane & Node Verification**: Verify the cluster control plane components (`kube-apiserver`, `etcd`, `kube-scheduler`, `kube-controller-manager`, and CNI networking) and inspect Docker container runtimes.
4. **Declarative Application Deployment**: Deploy a scalable NGINX web application across the cluster and analyze kube-scheduler pod distribution algorithms.
5. **Horizontal Scaling**: Scale the application workload dynamically from 3 replicas to 6 replicas, observing load distribution across worker nodes.
6. **Self-Healing Fault Tolerance Verification**: Test Kubernetes declarative state reconciliation by deliberately terminating active pods, observing ReplicaSet controller detection and automated zero-touch pod recreation.

---

## 🏗️ Architectural Topology

Each Kubernetes node in KinD runs as an independent Docker container operating within the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2) virtualized environment. The control-plane node hosts core Kubernetes services, while worker nodes run the container runtime, `kubelet`, `kube-proxy`, and application Pods.

## 📝 Cluster Configuration Manifest (`kind-config.yaml`)

To provision a production-like multi-node topology with separated control-plane and compute workers, the declarative manifest [`kind-config.yaml`](kind-config.yaml) was created:

```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
  - role: control-plane
  - role: worker
  - role: worker
```

- **`kind: Cluster`**: Declares that KinD should instantiate a Kubernetes cluster.
- **`apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4`**: Uses KinD's v1alpha4 schema.
- **`nodes`**: Defines three distinct virtual node containers:
  - 1 control plane node hosting the API server, scheduler, and etcd database.
  - 2 worker nodes dedicated exclusively to scheduling and executing user workloads.

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Execution & Command Workflow

### Part 1 & 2: Environment Readiness & Tool Verification

Prior to cluster creation, the underlying WSL 2 virtualization layer and Docker runtime were verified:

```powershell
# Verify WSL 2 installation status
wsl --status

# List registered Linux distributions and WSL version
wsl -l -v
```

#### Empirical Observations:
- Default distribution: **Ubuntu**
- Default WSL version: **2**
- Active running distributions: `docker-desktop` (State: **Running**, Version: 2) and `Ubuntu` (Version: 2).

---

### Part 3 & 4: Multi-Node Cluster Creation and Node Verification

The cluster was initiated using KinD and the custom configuration:

```powershell
# Navigate to lab workspace
cd C:\WINDOWS\system32\k8s-lab

# Create 3-node Kubernetes cluster
kind create cluster --config kind-config.yaml

# Verify cluster connectivity
kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind

# Verify node status
kubectl get nodes

# Inspect underlying Docker container instances
docker ps
```

#### Node Inventory & Status:
| Node Name | Kubernetes Status | Roles | Kubernetes Version | Underlying Docker Container ID | Mapped Ports |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`kind-control-plane`** | **Ready** | `control-plane` | `v1.37.0` | `6b16706fc603` | `127.0.0.1:65242->6443/tcp` |
| **`kind-worker`** | **Ready** | `<none>` | `v1.37.0` | `317ce8f4adcf` | Internal CNI network |

---

### Part 5: NGINX Deployment & Initial Pod Scheduling (3 Replicas)

A web server deployment was declared with an initial replica count of 3:

```powershell
# Deploy 3 replicas of the NGINX web server
kubectl create deployment web --image=nginx --replicas=3

# Verify deployment health
kubectl get deployments

# Inspect pod placement across worker nodes
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

#### Initial Pod Scheduling Distribution Table:
| Pod Name | Ready | Status | Restarts | Age | Pod IP Address | Node Assigned | Subnet CIDR |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **`web-5fc9f4bf66-lrvv7`** | `1/1` | **Running** | 0 | 6m25s | `10.244.2.3` | **`kind-worker`** | `10.244.2.0/24` |
| **`web-5fc9f4bf66-w9rd5`** | `1/1` | **Running** | 0 | 6m25s | `10.244.2.2` | **`kind-worker`** | `10.244.2.0/24` |
| **`web-5fc9f4bf66-rrnwx`** | `1/1` | **Running** | 0 | 6m25s | **`kind-worker2`** | `10.244.1.0/24` |

*Figure 3: `kubectl get pods -o wide` displaying 3 NGINX replicas distributed across `kind-worker` (2 pods) and `kind-worker2` (1 pod) with distinct pod IPs.*

---

### Part 6.1 & 6.2: Horizontal Scaling to 6 Replicas

The deployment was scaled up by 100% (from 3 to 6 replicas) to observe how `kube-scheduler` handles increased load across the available worker compute pool:

```powershell
# Scale deployment from 3 to 6 replicas
kubectl scale deployment web --replicas=6

# Check deployment state
kubectl get deployments

# Inspect balanced pod placement
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

#### Scaled 6-Pod Scheduling & Load Balancing Matrix:
| Pod Name | Ready | Status | Restarts | Age | IP Address | Host Node | Node Workload Share |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- | :---: |
| **`web-5fc9f4bf66-hpncv`** | `1/1` | **Running** | 0 | 50s | `10.244.2.4` | **`kind-worker`** | 3 / 6 (50%) |
| **`web-5fc9f4bf66-lrvv7`** | `1/1` | **Running** | 0 | 12m | `10.244.2.3` | **`kind-worker`** | 3 / 6 (50%) |
| **`web-5fc9f4bf66-w9rd5`** | `1/1` | **Running** | 0 | 12m | `10.244.2.2` | **`kind-worker`** | 3 / 6 (50%) |
| **`web-5fc9f4bf66-9jr2v`** | `1/1` | **Running** | 0 | 50s | `10.244.1.3` | **`kind-worker2`** | 3 / 6 (50%) |
| **`web-5fc9f4bf66-j5dv4`** | `1/1` | **Running** | 0 | 50s | `10.244.1.4` | **`kind-worker2`** | 3 / 6 (50%) |
| **`web-5fc9f4bf66-rrnwx`** | `1/1` | **Running** | 0 | 12m | `10.244.1.2` | **`kind-worker2`** | 3 / 6 (50%) |

### Part 6.3 & 6.4: Fault Injection & Automated Self-Healing Verification

To test Kubernetes high availability and self-healing resilience, an active pod was forcefully deleted to simulate node or container failure:

```powershell
# Observe pods in watch mode (or query before deletion)
kubectl get pods

# Force delete an active pod on kind-worker
kubectl delete pod web-5fc9f4bf66-lrvv7

# Immediately check pod status to detect reconciliation
kubectl get pods
```

#### Observed Self-Healing Lifecycle:
1. **Target Pod Termination**: Pod `web-5fc9f4bf66-lrvv7` was targeted and deleted (`pod "web-5fc9f4bf66-lrvv7" deleted from default namespace`).
2. **State Discrepancy Detection**: The Kubernetes `Deployment` / `ReplicaSet` control loop immediately detected an actual count of 5 pods versus the declared desired count of 6 pods.
3. **Automated Replacement Scheduling**: Within **5 seconds**, the controller spawned a brand new replacement pod: **`web-5fc9f4bf66-49nq9`**.
4. **Transient Image Verification**: During the initial 5 seconds, the replacement pod entered the image preparation phase (`0/1 ErrImagePull` / ContainerCreating transient state).

![Pod Deletion and Self-Healing Trigger](images/k8s_pod_delete_self_healing.png)
*Figure 5: PowerShell output showing the deliberate deletion of pod `web-5fc9f4bf66-lrvv7` and the instantaneous automated spawning of replacement pod `web-5fc9f4bf66-49nq9` by the ReplicaSet controller within 5 seconds.*

5. **Steady-State Recovery**: Once the container image was pulled and initialized, the replacement pod `web-5fc9f4bf66-49nq9` transitioned smoothly to **`1/1 Running`**, maintaining the desired 6/6 availability across the cluster with zero manual intervention.

```powershell
# Confirm steady-state recovery of the replacement pod
kubectl get pods
```

#### Final Pod Status Table:
| Pod Name | Ready | Status | Restarts | Age | Lifecycle Role |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **`web-5fc9f4bf66-49nq9`** | `1/1` | **Running** | 0 | 23m | **Automated Replacement (Self-Healed)** |
| **`web-5fc9f4bf66-9jr2v`** | `1/1` | **Running** | 0 | 25m | Stable Scaled Replica |
| **`web-5fc9f4bf66-hpncv`** | `1/1` | **Running** | 0 | 25m | Stable Scaled Replica |
| **`web-5fc9f4bf66-j5dv4`** | `1/1` | **Running** | 0 | 25m | Stable Scaled Replica |
| **`web-5fc9f4bf66-rrnwx`** | `1/1` | **Running** | 0 | 37m | Original Replica |
| **`web-5fc9f4bf66-w9rd5`** | `1/1` | **Running** | 0 | 37m | Original Replica |

## 📊 In-Depth Technical Analysis & Discussion

### 1. Declarative Architecture vs. Imperative Management
In traditional virtualization and manual container environments, if an application process crashes or a VM halts, an administrator or external watchdog script must detect the failure and manually issue restart commands. 

In Kubernetes:
- The administrator declares the **Desired State** (`replicas: 6`).
- The **ReplicaSet Controller** continuously executes a reconciliation control loop:
  $$\text{Discrepancy} = \text{Desired Replicas} - \text{Actual Replicas}$$
- When pod `lrvv7` was terminated, the discrepancy became $6 - 5 = +1$.
- The controller immediately submitted an API request to schedule and instantiate replacement pod `49nq9`, driving the system back to parity.

### 2. Multi-Node Scheduling & Pod Anti-Affinity Mechanics
`kube-scheduler` assigns unscheduled pods to nodes using two filtering/scoring phases:
- **Filtering (Predicates)**: Filters out nodes that do not meet resource requirements, taints, or port constraints.
- **Scoring (Priorities)**: Scores remaining eligible candidate nodes. To minimize blast radius and ensure high availability, the default scoring algorithm favors spreading pods evenly across distinct failure domains (nodes).
- This is empirically demonstrated in Part 6.2: when scaling to 6 pods, exactly **3 pods were placed on `kind-worker`** and **3 pods were placed on `kind-worker2`**, achieving optimal $50\% - 50\%$ distribution without manual node selector rules.

### 3. Container Network Interface (CNI) IP Allocation
KinD provisions a Kindnet CNI bridge that provides unique, non-overlapping IPv4 subnets for each worker node:
- `kind-worker`: Assigned subnet `10.244.2.0/24` (Pods received IPs `10.244.2.2`, `10.244.2.3`, `10.244.2.4`).
- `kind-worker2`: Assigned subnet `10.244.1.0/24` (Pods received IPs `10.244.1.2`, `10.244.1.3`, `10.244.1.4`).
Every pod receives its own routable IP within the cluster SDN, enabling flat, direct pod-to-pod networking without NAT.
